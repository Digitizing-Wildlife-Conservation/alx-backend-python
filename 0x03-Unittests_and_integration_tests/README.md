0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests UnitTests Back-end Integration tests Cohort

This project focuses on learning unittests and integration tests in Python 3, using the parameterized module. Two tasks were completed: 1) Writing a unit test for utils.access_nested_map with various inputs and 2) Implementing a unit test to check exceptions using assertRaises. Both tasks involve TestAccessNestedMap class inheriting from unittest.TestCase and utilize @parameterized.expand to test different scenarios.

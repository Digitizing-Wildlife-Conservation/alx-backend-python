Async Comprehension
Welcome to the Async Comprehension project! This repository, led by Moses Muchai, a Lead Software Engineer at Holberton ALX SE and supported by the Software Engineering Master Card Foundation, is designed to enhance your understanding of asynchronous comprehensions in Python 3. Within this project, you'll find three key tasks:

Async Generator:
Delve into 0-async_generator.py to explore an asynchronous coroutine called async_generator. This coroutine loops 10 times, asynchronously waiting for 1 second each time, then yields a random number between 0 and 10, leveraging the random module.
Async Comprehensions:
Journey into 1-async_comprehension.py, where you'll encounter a script importing async_generator from the previous task. It introduces a coroutine named async_comprehension, which adeptly collects 10 random numbers using an async comprehension over async_generator, culminating in their return.
Runtime Measurement for Four Parallel Comprehensions:
Finally, delve into 2-measure_runtime.py, where async_comprehension is imported from the previous file. Here, the measure_runtime coroutine is crafted to execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather, meticulously measuring and returning the total runtime.
With these tasks, you're poised to expand your proficiency in asynchronous comprehensions and elevate your Python programming skills. Dive in, explore, and enjoy the journey of mastering async comprehensions!

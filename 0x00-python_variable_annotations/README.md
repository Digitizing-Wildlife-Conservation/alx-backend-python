0x00. Python - Variable Annotations Python Back-end

Lead Software Engineer Moses Muchai at Holberton MasterCard Foundation ALX SE Software Engineering Short Specialization presents a project focused on learning variable and type annotations in Python 3. The tasks include creating annotated functions for basic operations like addition, concatenation, flooring, and conversion to string. Additionally, the project involves defining and annotating variables with specified values, handling complex types such as lists of floats and mixed lists of integers and floats, as well as converting strings and int/float pairs into tuples.
